## <a id="iteration"></a> Iteration

[Example files...](../Examples/Iterations/)

ES6 standardized a specific protocol for the iterator pattern directly in the language. The protocol defines a **next()** method whose return is an object called an **iterator result;** the object has value and done properties, where done is a boolean that is false until the iteration over the underlying data source is complete.

**Consuming Iterators**

ES6 also included several mechanisms (syntax and APIs) for standardized consumption of these iterators.

_the for...of loop_

```
// given an iterator of some data source:
var it = /* .. */;
// loop over its results one at a time
for(let val of it)
{
    console.log(`Iterator value:${val}`);
}
// Iterator value: ..
// Iterator value: ..
// ..
```

_the ... operator_

This operator actually has two symmetrical forms: spread and rest

```
// An array spread:
// spread an iterator into an array,
// with each iterated value occupying
// an array element position.
var vals = [ ...it ];

//A function call spread:
// spread an iterator into a function,
// call with each iterated value
// occupying an argument position.
doSomethingUseful( ...it );
```

The iterator-spread form of **...** follows the iterator-consumption protocol (the same as the **for..of** loop) to retrieve all available values from an iterator and place (aka, spread)them into the receiving context (array, argument list).

**Iterables**

The iterator-consumption protocol is technically defined for consuming iterables; an iterable is a value that can be iterated over.
ES6 defined the basic data structure/collection types in JS as iterables. This includes strings, arrays, maps, sets, and others.

**Array**

```
// an array is an iterable
var arr=[10,20,30];

for(let val of arr) {
    console.log(`Array value:${val}`);
}
// Array value: 10
// Array value: 20
// Array value: 30

//Since arrays are iterables,
//we can shallow-copy an array using iterator
//consumption via the ... spread operator
var arrCopy=[ ...arr ];

//We can also iterate the characters in a string one at a time:
var greeting="Hello world!";
var chars=[ ...greeting ];
chars;
// [ "H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ",
//   "w", "o", "r", "l", "d", "!" ]
```

**Map**

A Map data structure uses objects as keys, associating a value (of any type) with that object.
An entry is a tuple (2-element array) including both a key and a value.

```
// given two DOM elements, `btn1` and `btn2`
var buttonNames = newMap();
buttonNames.set(btn1,"Button 1");
buttonNames.set(btn2,"Button 2");

for(let [btn,btnName] of buttonNames) {
    btn.addEventListener("click",function onClick(){
        console.log(`Clicked ${ btnName }`);
    });
}
```

For the most part, all built-in iterables in JS have three iterator forms available: keys-only(keys()), values-only(values()), and entries (entries()).

```
for(let btnName of buttonNames.values()) {
    console.log(btnName);
}
// Button 1
// Button 2

var arr=[10,20,30];
for( let [idx,val] of arr.entries()) {
    console.log(`[${idx}]:${val}`);
}
// [0]: 10
// [1]: 20
// [2]: 30
```

## <a id="closure"></a> Closure

[Example files...](../Examples/Closure/)

Closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables from out side its scope, even when the function is executed in a different scope.
-Closure is part of the nature of a function.
-To observe a closure, you must execute a function in a different scope than where that function was originally defined.
-These closures are not a snapshot of the variable value; they are a direct link and preservation of the variable itself.
-Closure is most common when working with asynchronous code, such as with callbacks.
-It’s not necessary that the outer scope be a function just that there be at least one variable in an outer scope accessed from an inner function

```
function greeting(msg) {
  return function who(name) {
    console.log(`${msg},${name}!`);
  };
}
var hello = greeting("Hello");
var howdy = greeting("Howdy");
hello("Kyle"); // Hello, Kyle!
hello("Sarah"); // Hello, Sarah!
howdy("Grant"); // Howdy, Grant!
```

Since the inner function instances are still alive (assigned to hello and howdy, respectively), their closures are still preserving the _msg_ variables.

Closure can actually observe (or make!) updatesto these variables over time.

```
function counter(step = 1) {
  var count = 0;
  return function increaseCount() {
    count = count + step;
    return count;
  };
}
var incBy1 = counter(1);
var incBy3 = counter(3);
console.log(`incBy1() = ${incBy1()}`); // 1
console.log(`incBy1() = ${incBy1()}`); // 2
console.log(`incBy3() = ${incBy3()}`); // 3
console.log(`incBy3() = ${incBy3()}`); // 6
console.log(`incBy3() = ${incBy3()}`); // 9
```

Async call

```
function getSomeData(url) {
  ajax(url, function onResponse(resp) {
    console.log(`Response (from${url}):${resp}`);
  });
}
getSomeData("https://some.url/wherever"); // Response (from https://some.url/wherever): ...

```

Outer scope not a function example

```
for (let [idx, btn] of buttons.entries()) {
  btn.addEventListener("click", function onClick() {
    console.log(`Clicked on button (${idx})!`);
  });
}
```

## <a id="thisKeyword"></a> this Keyword

[Example files...](../Examples/This/)

Functions have another characteristic besides their scope thati nfluences what they can access. This characteristic is best described as an **execution context**, and it’s exposed to the function via its **this** keyword.

Scope is static and contains a fixed set of variables available at the moment and location you define a function, but a function’s **execution context** is dynamic, entirely dependent on how it is called (regardless of where it is defined or even called from).

-**this** is rather a dynamic characteristic that’s determined each time the function is called.

The benefit of this-aware functions—and their dynamic context—is the ability to more flexibly re-usea single function with data from different objects. A function that closes over a scope can never reference a different scope or set of variables. But a function that has dynamic this context awareness can be quite helpful for certain tasks.

```
function classroom(teacher) {
  return function study() {
    console.log(`${teacher} says to study ${this.topic}`);
  };
}
var assignment = classroom("Kyle");
assignment();// Kyle says to study undefined

var homework = { topic: "JS", assignment };
homework.assignment(); // Kyle says to study JS

var otherHomework = { topic: "Math" };
assignment.call(otherHomework); // Kyle says to study Math

```

## <a id="prototypes"></a> Prototypes

[Example files...](../Examples/Prototypes/)

Where **this** is a characteristic of function execution, a **prototype** is a characteristic of an object, and specifically resolution of a property access.
A series of objects linked together via prototypes is called the “prototype chain.”
The purpose of this prototype linkage (i.e., from an object B to another object A) is so that accesses against B for properties/methods that B does not have, are delegated to A to handle

```
var homework = {topic:"JS"};
homework.toString();// [object Object]
```

The homework object only has a single property on it: topic. However, its default prototype linkage connects to the Object.prototype object, which has common built-in methods on it like toString()and valueOf(), among others.

**Object Linkage**

To define an object prototype linkage, you can create the object using the Object.create(..)utility:

```
var homework = { topic: "JS" };
var otherHomework = Object.create(homework);
console.log(otherHomework.topic); // "JS"

console.log(homework.topic);// "JS"
console.log(otherHomework.topic);// "JS"

otherHomework.topic="Math";
console.log(otherHomework.topic);// "Math"
console.log(homework.topic);// "JS" -- not "Math"
```

Object.create(null) creates an object that is not prototype linked anywhere, so it’s purely just a standalone object.

**thisRevisited**

Indeed, one of the main reasons **this** supports dynamic context based on how the function is called is so that method calls on objects which delegate through the prototype chain still maintain the expected **this**.

```
var homework = {
  study() {
    console.log(`Please study ${this.topic}`);
  },
};

var jsHomework = Object.create(homework);
jsHomework.topic = "JS";
jsHomework.study(); // Please study JS

var mathHomework = Object.create(homework);
mathHomework.topic = "Math";
mathHomework.study(); // Please study Math
```

Unlike many other languages, JS’s **this** being dynamic is a critical component of allowing prototype delegation, and indeed class, to work as expected!
