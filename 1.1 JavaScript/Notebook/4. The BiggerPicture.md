# Digging tothe Roots of JS

1. [Pillar 1: Scope and Closure](#scopeAndClosure)
2. [Pillar 2: Prototypes](#prototypes)
3. [Pillar 3: Types and Coercion](#typesAndCoercion)

## <a id="scopeAndClosure"></a>Pillar 1: Scope and Closure

Scopes nest inside each other, and for any given expression orstatement, only variables at that level of scope nesting, or inhigher/outer scopes, are accessible; variables from lower/inner scopes are hidden and inaccessible.

Closure is a natural result of lexical scope when the language has functions as first-class values, as JS does. When a function makes reference to variables from an outer scope, and that function is passed around as a value and executed in other scopes, it maintains access to its original scope variables; this is closure.

## <a id="prototypes"></a> Pillar 2: Prototypes

JS is one of very few languages where you have the option to create objects directly and explicitly, without first defining their structure in a class.
The ability for two objects to simply connect with each other and cooperate dynamically (during function/method execution) through sharing a **this** context.

## <a id="typesAndCoercion"></a> Pillar 3: Types and Coercion

Arguably, this pillar is more important than the other two, in the sense that no JS program will do anything useful if it doesn’t properly leverage JS’s value types, as well as the conversion (coercion) of values between types.
