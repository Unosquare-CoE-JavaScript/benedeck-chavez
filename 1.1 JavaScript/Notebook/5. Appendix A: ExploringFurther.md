## <a id="valuesVSReferences"></a>Values vs. References

In many languages, the developer can choose between assigning/passing a value as the value itself, or as a reference to the value. In JS, however, this decision is entirely determined by the kind of value.

- Primitive values are always assigned/passed as value copies.

```
var myName = "Kyle";
var yourName = myName;

myName = "Frank";

console.log(myName);// Frank
console.log(yourName);// Kyle
```

- In JS, only object values(arrays,objects,functions,etc.) are treated as references.

```
var myAddress = {
  street: "123 JS Blvd",
  city: "Austin",
  state: "TX",
};
var yourAddress = myAddress; // I've got to move to a new house!
myAddress.street = "456 TS Ave";

console.log(yourAddress.street); // 456 TS Ave
```

## <a id="functionForms"></a> So Many Function Forms

There are, regrettably in some respects, many other function definition forms in JS

```
// generator function declaration
function *two() { .. }

// async function declaration
async function three() { .. }

// async generator function declaration
async function *four() { .. }

// named function export declaration (ES6 modules)
export function five() { .. }

// IIFE
(function(){ .. })();
(function namedIIFE(){ .. })();

// asynchronous IIFE
(async function(){ .. })();
(async function namedAIIFE(){ .. })();

// arrow function expressions
var f;
f=() =>42;
f=x => x*2;
f=(x) => x*2;
f=(x,y) => x*y;
f=x => ({ x:x*2});f=x => {return x*2; };
f= async x => {var y= await doSomethingAsync(x); return y*2;};
someOperation( x => x*2);

```

- Arrow function expressions are syntactically anonymous, meaning the syntax doesn’t provide away to provide a direct name identifier for the function.
- This kind of function actually has a specific purpose (i.e., handling the this keyword lexically)

Functions can also be specified in class definitions and object literal definitions.

```
class SomethingKindaGreat {
    // class methods
    coolMethod() { .. }// no commas!
    boringMethod() { .. }
}

var EntirelyDifferent = {
    // object methods
    coolMethod() { .. },// commas!
    boringMethod() { .. },

    // (anonymous) function expression property
    oldSchool:function() { .. }
};
```

## <a id="coerciveConditionalComparison"> Coercive Conditional Comparison

**if** and **? :**-ternary statements, as well as the test clauses in while and for loops, all perform an implicit value comparison. But what sort? Is it “strict” or “coercive”? Both, actually.

```
var x = "hello";

if(x) {
    // will run!
}

while(x) {
    // will run, once!
    x = false;
}

if(Boolean(x) == true) {
    // will run
}

// which is the same as:
if(Boolean(x) === true) {
    // will run
}
```

Since theBoolean(..)function always returns a value of type boolean, the **==** vs **===** in this snippet is irrelevant; they’ll both do the same thing. But the important part is to see that before the comparison, a coercion occurs, from what ever type x currently is, to boolean.

## <a id="prototypalClasses"> Prototypal “Classes”

Another way of wiring up such prototype linkages served as the predecessor to the elegance of the ES6 class system, and is referred to as prototypal classes.

```
functionClassroom() {// ..}
Classroom.prototype.welcome = function hello() {
    console.log("Welcome, students!");
};

var mathClass = newClassroom();
mathClass.welcome();// Welcome, students!
```

All functions by default reference an empty object at a property named prototype. Despite the confusing naming,this is not the function’s prototype(where the function is prototype linked to), but rather the prototype object to link to when other objects are created by calling the function with new.
